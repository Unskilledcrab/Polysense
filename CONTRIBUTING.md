Thank you for wanting to help contribute to this project!

Please take a look at the latest issues and projects to find something you feel comfortable working on, when you begin follow the feature / bug branching method and tie all of your commits to that issue

for example: if you are working on the bug "Issue #2 - UI Updating Issue" then the steps would be as
1) Create a branch from the development branch calling it "bug/2-UI-Update-Fix" 
- bug/[issue number]-[issue description]
- OR feature/[issue number]-[issue description]
2) Make changes in your local branch to fix the issue making sure to tag all commits to the issue and use [these keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) to manage the issue's lifecycle
- "#2 changed ui method call"
- "#2 updated properties"
- "closes #2 minor adjustments and code clean up" (NOTE: this commit uses the 'closes' keyword to automatically close the issue when the PR is merged)
3) Merge any changes from the development branch into your "bug/2-UI-Update-Fix" branch
4) Submit a [New Pull Request](https://github.com/Unskilledcrab/Polysense/compare) on the development branch
